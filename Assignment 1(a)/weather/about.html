            As long as you have a smartphone, you receive weather forecasts on
            your phone. Especially when you have switched on data or if there is
            going to be a change in weather. In the past, weather forecasting was
            done by first observing weather conditions of the last few decades and
            their behavior pattern. Then they would also collect information from
            various weather satellites, look at them side by side and conclude.

          <b><h3>What the weather app do?</h3></b>
          As long as you have a smartphone, you receive weather forecasts on
          your phone. Especially when you have switched on data or if there is
          going to be a change in weather. In the past, weather forecasting was
          done by first observing weather conditions of the last few decades and
          their behavior pattern. Then they would also collect information from
          various weather satellites, look at them side by side and conclude.
          <br /><br />
          <b><h3>How do these Apps get this information?</h3></b>
          Weather apps gather information differently. Some get it from
          government satellites, some use their tech and teams of
          meteorologists. The tools they commonly use are weather satellites and
          Doppler radar. Weather forecasts vary depending on the app you are
          using. <br /><br />
          <b><h3>AccuWeather Channel</h3></b> AccuWeather Channel has its own
          patented technology called AccuWeather Exclusive RealFeel Temperature.
          It is not open to all. The effect of the temperature, humidity, wind,
          sunshine intensity, precipitation, cloudiness, and elevation on the
          human body are used to determine the temperature and other readings.
          They collect information using Gyroscopes and barometers, inbuilt into
          mobile devices. <br /><br />

          <b><h3>The Weather channel</h3></b> The Weather Channel is
          incorporated with satellite and Doppler radar to provide highly
          accurate weather information on your smartphones. It uses Ultra Local
          True Point Forecasting technology to find the best weather reports. It
          has over 200 meteorologists gathering and processing information.
          <br /><br />
          <b><h3>Indian Satellite Weather</h3></b> Indian Satellite Weather is
          basic. It only provides images of cloud information to determine
          weather conditions. It uses IMD’s satellite to collect the images.
